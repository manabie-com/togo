### How to run the code
1. Using your command line or terminal, cd to this folder path
2. Once the command line or terminal is already showing the folder path on the left of the blinking under score symbol(_), type in go run main.go then hit enter
3. After that, you can already call the apis

I want to be honest and not search how to do curl and unit testing on Golang because I personally don't know how to do those.
