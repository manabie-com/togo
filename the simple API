So sorry!
I'm not pushing code here. Because it is not Golang language.
I was researching the Golang and several frameworks as "revel" to build the simple API. However, I had some matters.
Maybe I push it when I complete it(if you are interested).
You can see other sample abode links. It builds based on the laravel framework. I know it is not exactly your assignment test, but the testing that to help us know can work together.
And I really need a reason to switch to other languages/frameworks.
I'm interested in Golang cause It is simple, shortly, focuses on data, and quality
