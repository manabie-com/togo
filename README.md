### How to run your code locally?
mpm install

node migrations/database.js

npm start

### A sample “curl” command to call your API
- api get all user: GET: http://localhost:3000/user/list
   response:
    [
        {
            "_id": "62a8d6faecf2e20029fd3435",      => user_id used for todo api
            "user_name": "user01",
            "email": "user01@gmail.com",
            "limit_task_per_day": 1                 => limited user todo tasks per day
        },
        ...
    ]

- api create a todo task

    params: {
        title: 
        description:
        user_id:   // user_id is user unique ID get from api get all user.
    }

    curl -d "title=title 1&description=description 1&user_id=62a8d6faecf2e20029fd3435" -X POST http://localhost:3000/todo/add

### What do you love about your solution?
- Simple structure that is easy to develop and extend 

### What else do you want us to know about however you do not have enough time to complete?
- I'll do the integration and unit tests.
- Todo task api call by user authentication (create-self task) and admin (asign taks)
- APi for update limited tasks per user
