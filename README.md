### A sample “curl” command to call your API

- curl -i -X POST localhost:8080/api/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"username\":\"hungnk\",\"password\":\"admin123\"}"
- As soon as run this command it will generate Jwt Token
- assign to "Authorization": "Bearer {#token}" to api createTask, createUser called after login;
  - Ex call api after login: 
    - curl -i -X POST localhost:8080/api/createTask -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer {#token}" -d "{\"id\":\"M01\",\"content\":\"doning01\",\"userId\":\"hungnk\",\"createdDate\":\"2022-06-24\" }"
    - {#token} is token received at the time login
    - create user with the following curl: 
	- curl -i -X POST localhost:8080/api/createUser -H "Content-Type: application/json" H "Authorization: Bearer {#token}" -d "{\"username\":\"trungst\",\"password\":\"admin1234\",\"maxLimitTodo\": 2}"

### How to run your unit tests locally?

- Currently, I can't run unit tests in cmd, if you want to run then open java IDE like Eclipse, Intellij... I apologize for the inconvenience.

### What do you love about your solution?

- Currently this project I am using MVC pattern, it divides the structure very clearly so it is easy to change and maintain.

### What else do you want us to know about however you do not have enough time to complete?

   - I still can't configure unit test to run on cmd, I feel pretty bad for this.
